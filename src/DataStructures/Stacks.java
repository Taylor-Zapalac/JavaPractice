	 * Stacks
	 * ------
	 * Data collections, way to hold multiple items
	 * Think stack of papers, stack of books, just a stack
	 * When added to the stack you add to the top
	 * and when you remove, you take it from the top.
	 * Last in -> first out
	 * LIFO Structure
	 * Do not have numeric index
	 * All we need is add and remove. that's all we care about
	 * or Push and Pop
	 * We can Peek, which shows you the top data, but does not remove like pop
	 * Very simple because there is not much you can do with it.
	 * 
	 * If you want to do anything other than Push, Pop, or Peek you are using the wrong data structure
