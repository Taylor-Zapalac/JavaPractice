	 * Array: Contiguous area of memory consisting of equal-size elements by contiguous integers.
	 * Zero-Based indexing
	 * Constant time access means we can access any point at any time.
	 * Once initialized, in Java, it cannot be resized.
	 * Ordered collection of items. Can be any object.
	 * 
	 * Why restrict when the size cannot be changed, if lists exist?
	 * Uses less resources. Most of the time, more restrictions means smaller faster code.
	 * 
	 * If we dont know size, list would probably be a better idea.
